# ATM Bank App

This app works like an ATM, allowing you to perform four different operations:
- Check your balance.
- Make a deposit.
- Make a widthdraw.
- Get a list of transactions.

I have created 3 class for this App.

##  Bank Account Class
I set up the following properties in this class:
- Account Number
- Name Customer
- Balance
- List of transactions.
- Deposits.
- Widthdraw.

## Transaccion Class
My next step was to create a Transaction class with the following properties:
- Account Number
- Amount
- Date
- Notes(if the payment was by cash or cheque)
- Transactions.

## Program class
Finally, I created a Program class
